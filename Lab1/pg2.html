			<h2>New Galaxy S8 rumors: April 21 launch date, rear-mounted fingerprint sensor and more</h2>

			<p>
				Now that Samsung has officially moved on from the disastrous Galaxy Note 7 launch, the rumors about the company’s next smartphone, the Galaxy S8, seem to be picking up speed. The latest such report comes from The Guardian, which repeats a number of rumors about the phone along with adding a few new ones as well.
				
				<br>The report, which cites unnamed sources, claims the phone could go on sale on or around April 21, a few days later than previous launch date reports that targeted April 18. While Samsung has yet to officially confirm a launch date for its next flagship, we can expect the device to be unveiled in the mid- to late-April timeframe.

				<br>The Guardian’s report agrees with previous rumors, renders and display shell photo leaks that show the Galaxy S8 will come in two sizes. Still, there’s no specific word on how large they will be; only that the phones will be between 5 and 6 inches, according to the report (pretty descriptive, right?). Both versions will feature edge-to-edge screens with almost no bezel, too.

				<br>The S8 might be the first Samsung device with a rear-mounted fingerprint sensor
				And because the S8 will supposedly have nearly no bezel surrounding the screen, where will the fingerprint sensor go? Like many other smartphones on the market right now, Samsung will supposedly move the S8’s fingerprint sensor to the back of the phone.

				<br>A few other hardware details in this report: the phone will (thankfully) keep the 3.5mm headphone jack, and also sport the same iris scanner that was found on the Note 7. The rear camera on the S8 will supposedly be only an incremental upgrade from the S7’s camera, as well. That’s not really a bad thing, though, as the S7’s camera has been one of the best on the market since its launch.

				<br>The Galaxy S8 will come with a 3.5mm headphone jack and an iris scanner
				The report also claims that we can expect a new version of Samsung’s Gear VR headset and a new Gear 360 camera to launch alongside the Galaxy S8. Samsung might also launch new “DeX” accessories, such as a dock, that could turn the phone into a Android desktop PC when the dock is also connected to a keyboard, mouse and monitor. The article repeats rumors about the phone’s alleged Bixby digital assistant, and seems to believe the phone will come with the new Qualcomm Snapdragon 835 processor inside. Indeed, another rumor claims that Samsung has managed to corner the early market for this processor, which means the Galaxy S8 may be the first to have it inside.

				<br>Of course, all of these reports have yet to be officially confirmed by Samsung, and it’s possible that the company’s plans may chance for the Galaxy S8 between now and launch time. One thing is for sure – because of the failed launch of the Note 7, the release of the Galaxy S8 could be the most important product launch in Samsung’s history, and you can bet they will take great pains to make sure it goes off without a hitch.

			<h2>New LG G6 leaks: New image, Google Assistant, and no removable battery</h2>
			<p>	
				LG will announce the G6 on February 26, a day before Mobile World Congress officially kicks off in Barcelona. The device is already confirmed to feature a 5.7-inch QHD+ screen, heat pipes, advanced AI and quality tests that are “higher than international standards”. Most of the remaining specs are just rumors for now.

				<br>A few more rumors regarding the upcoming flagship from LG have just surfaced though. Some of them are new, while others have been talked about before. “A person familiar with the company’s plans” talked to CNET saying that the G6 will have a sealed battery like some of the Galaxy S phones and will, therefore, be waterproof.

				<br>The battery obviously won’t be removable, which also means that the modular design seen on last year’s G5 is a thing of the past for LG. Is this a good or a bad thing? Well, it really comes down to whether the modular design of the G5 was of any real value to you. It certainly didn’t do LG any good as it didn’t help to increase sales of the smartphone, but abandoning modularity so soon will be rough for anyone that bought into the LG Friends ecosystem.
				
				<br>CNET also reports that the LG G6 will ship with Google’s Assistant on board. If this is true, LG’s flagship will be the first phone, aside from the Pixel and Pixel XL, to feature the popular digital assistant.

				<br>But apparently, Assistant wasn’t LG’s first choice. The company has a strong partnership with Amazon and initially wanted to include Alexa on the G6. According to CNET, Amazon’s digital assistant didn’t feel quite ready yet, so LG took the next best thing and opted for Google’s Assistant, but the company still plans on bringing Alexa to its devices later this year.
				
				<br>In addition to the rumors, we have also come across a new image of the LG G6 (see above) which recently leaked. It shows the upcoming device from the side, revealing the SIM card slot that looks pretty long, and therefore suggests that the device will also support microSD card expansion. This is the second image of the G6 that has leaked so far. If you want to see the first one, check out our “This could be our first real look at the upcoming LG G6” post.
